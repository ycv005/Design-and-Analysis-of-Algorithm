# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm
An Algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem. Design and Analysis of Algorithm is very important for designing algorithm to solve different types of problems in the branch of computer science and information technology.

In Simple Word,
Design of Algorithm means we have a Problem and we need to find out the way or Algorithm to solve out that problem.
Now, Analysis of Algorithm means that How efficiently we are solving out the problem. Here, Efficiency depends on the Time and Space. 

Now, If we take about importance, I means which is more important, Time or Space, then in Today's world, Time is very important.
